## Why I Built This

There is no universal India → US GPA conversion formula.  
Students often struggle to understand how their academic profile might be viewed abroad.

This tool provides a practical estimate and a structured readiness signal.

It does **not** predict admissions outcomes.

## Notes

I used AI assistance to help structure parts of the code and handle edge cases more cleanly,  
but the idea, logic design, and implementation decisions are my own.
